# Ethereum Smart Contract

This repository contains an Ethereum smart contract deployed on the Sepolia testnet.

## What is a Smart Contract?

A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. It automatically executes actions when predefined conditions are met. In the context of blockchain technology, smart contracts are deployed on a blockchain network, such as Ethereum, and are immutable and transparent.

## Deployment Details

The smart contract in this repository has been deployed on the Sepolia testnet. The Sepolia testnet is a testing environment that allows developers to experiment with smart contracts and interact with the Ethereum network without using real Ether (ETH) tokens.
